# What is NOT covered in this Workshop?

- This workshop is not a deep dive into each and every topic. It is covering some advanced concepts, but you may need additional documentation and training to understand every topic in details.  
  For additional information please refer to the following resources:
  - [Ansible AVD Documentation](https://avd.arista.com/)
  - [VSCode Documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs)
  - [Git Documentation](https://git-scm.com/doc) - Pro Git book is a good start
  - Container Trainings by [@jpetazzo](https://github.com/jpetazzo):
    - [Github repository](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training)
    - [Training materials](https://container.training/)
- We are not going to use Arista CloudVision Portal (CVP) in this workshop. It provides a lot of advantages, but is not essential to understand the concepts covered.
- If you will not find something you expect in this workshop, there can be 2 reasons:
  - There are no plans to cover it
  - It is waiting for your contribution to this repository! ü§ù
