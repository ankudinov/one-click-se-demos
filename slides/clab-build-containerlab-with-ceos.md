# How To Run The Workshop

<style scoped>section {font-size: 24px;}</style>

To run the labs in this workshop, you can use one of the following options:

- Build you own Ubuntu VM from scratch. (Recommended!)
  - This option will allow you to experience the entire cLab enviroment build process from the very start, without any pre-installed dependancies
  - Requirements
    - Ubuntu LTS 22.04 or later
    - 8 GB RAM and 4 vCPUs
- Start the [Github Codespace](https://codespaces.new/{{gh.repository}}?quickstart=1&devcontainer_path=.devcontainer%2Fclab-build-containerlab-with-ceos%2Fdevcontainer.json) from this repository. (Fastest!)
- Open the lab dev container locally on your laptop with Docker Desktop or sever with Docker CE:
  - you can [download required files here](https://arista-netdevops-community.github.io/one-click-se-demos/lab_archives/clab-build-containerlab-with-ceos.tar.gz) and open them in VSCode
  - when running the lab locally, you must set all required environment variables on your machine

---

# CPU Architechture

- Only x86 CPU architecture is supported!
- It is technically possible to [run Container lab on ARM](https://containerlab.dev/install/#containerlab-on-arm-based-macs), but there are no network device images available for ARM as of May 2024.

---

# Setup Docker on the Host

<style scoped>section {font-size: 22px;}</style>

<div class="columns">
<div>

> Check if Docker is already installed. In this case you can skip the steps below.

1. Install Docker on the host. The detailed instructions are available [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/). You can used one-liner script for that.
2. Add your user to the `docker` group.
3. Logout and login again to apply the changes.
4. Check the Docker version and run `hello-world` container to test functionality.
5. You must be able to run `docker` commands without `sudo` if it was installed correctly.

</div>
<div>

```bash
# install Docker
sudo curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com | sh
# add user to the docker group
sudo usermod -aG docker ${USER}
# test docker
docker --version
docker run hello-world
```

> **NOTE**: If you are running this workshop in Codespace or provided dev container, Docker is pre-installed. As the workshop magic happens inside a container in this case, we rely on Docker-in-Docker concept to provide required functionality.

</div>
</div>

---

# Setup Git (Optional)

<style scoped>section {font-size: 26px;}</style>

- Git must be pre-installed on a Linux system. Otherwise you are in a wrong place. Escape! ðŸ‘¾ ðŸš€
- Setup your name and email address:

  ```bash
  git config --global user.name "<first-and-2nd-name>"
  git config --global user.email "<your-email>"
  ```

- Check the current configuration:

  ```bash
  git config --list
  ```

> **NOTE**: On Codespace Git is pre-installed and pre-configured.

---

# Download cEOS-lab Image

<style scoped>section {font-size: 20px;}</style>

1. Login to [Arista Software Download](https://www.arista.com/en/support/software-download) portal. You need to have an account to download the image.
2. Select `EOS > Active Releases > 4.30 > EOS-4.30.6M > cEOS-lab`.
3. Download `cEOS-lab-4.30.6M.tar.xz` image.
4. Upload the image to your lab VM. For example, you can use SFTP to transfer the image:

  ```bash
  sftp ${REMOTE_USER}@${UBUNTU_VM_IP}:/home/${REMOTE_USER}/${IMAGE_DIR} <<< $'put cEOS-lab-4.30.6M.tar*'
  # for example:
  # sftp user@10.10.10.11:/home/user/images <<< $'put cEOS-lab-4.30.6M.tar*'
  ```

> If Github Codespace or provided Dev Container is used and the Arista token is set, the image will be pulled from arista.com automatically.

# Import cEOS-lab Image

<style scoped>section {font-size: 22px;}</style>

1. Go to the directory with the uploaded image and import the image:

    ```bash
    docker import cEOS-lab-4.30.6M.tar.xz arista/ceos:4.30.6M
    ```

    > NOTE: you can also import the image with the tag latest to allow quick "upgrade" of those lab where specific version is not required: `docker tag arista/ceos:4.30.6M arista/ceos:latest`

2. Confirm that the image was imported successfully:

    ```console
    $ docker image ls
    REPOSITORY    TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED          SIZE
    arista/ceos      4.30.6M   21b540a4a343   45 minutes ago   1.95GB
    arista/ceos      latest    21b540a4a343   45 minutes ago   1.95GB
    hello-world   latest    b038788ddb22   3 months ago     9.14kB
    ```

---

# Install Containerlab

<style scoped>section {font-size: 22px;}</style>

- It's just a one-liner:
  
  ```bash
  bash -c "$(curl -sL https://get.containerlab.dev)"
  ```

- Refer to the [Containerlab quick start documentation](https://containerlab.dev/quickstart/) for the details.

---

# Deploy The Lab

<style scoped>section {font-size: 20px;}</style>

![bg right 80%](img/clab-build-containerlab-with-ceos/min-l3ls-mlag.png)

- Inspect `topology.clab.yml` and deploy the lab:

  ```bash
  sudo containerlab deploy
  ```

- This command will deploy Containerlab with the default EOS configuration provided by Containerlab.
- (Optional): you can add `--debug` flag to get additional information while Containerlab is starting.

> NOTE: there is no need to specify topology file explicitely, as there only one `.clab.yml` file in the current directory. When multiple topologies are present, the topology to be started must be specified explicitely.

---

# Inspect the Lab

<style scoped>section {font-size: 12px;}</style>

Once the lab is ready, you'll see a table with the list of deployed containers, their host names and management IPs:

```text
+---+------+--------------+---------------------+------+---------+--------------+--------------+
| # | Name | Container ID |        Image        | Kind |  State  | IPv4 Address | IPv6 Address |
+---+------+--------------+---------------------+------+---------+--------------+--------------+
| 1 | h01  | 5367c60bcb1c | arista/ceos:4.30.6M | ceos | running | 10.0.3.1/16  | N/A          |
| 2 | l01  | 783f209af70e | arista/ceos:4.30.6M | ceos | running | 10.0.2.1/16  | N/A          |
| 3 | l02  | 47f9904801ce | arista/ceos:4.30.6M | ceos | running | 10.0.2.2/16  | N/A          |
| 4 | s01  | 82812ceefb42 | arista/ceos:4.30.6M | ceos | running | 10.0.1.1/16  | N/A          |
| 5 | s02  | 2839bc4a1ca7 | arista/ceos:4.30.6M | ceos | running | 10.0.1.2/16  | N/A          |
+---+------+--------------+---------------------+------+---------+--------------+--------------+
```

> You can call the table again any time with `sudo clab inspect -t topology.clab.yml`. Or simply `sudo clab inspect`.

Containerlab creates corresponding entries in the `/etc/hosts` file as well:

```bash
$ cat /etc/hosts | grep clab- -A 5
###### CLAB-build-clab-with-ceos-START ######
10.0.2.1        l01
10.0.2.2        l02
10.0.1.1        s01
10.0.1.2        s02
10.0.3.1        h01
###### CLAB-build-clab-with-ceos-END ######
```

You can also list containers using docker command:

```console
$ docker container ls
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                 COMMAND                  CREATED          STATUS          PORTS     NAMES
5367c60bcb1c   arista/ceos:4.30.6M   "bash -c '/mnt/flashâ€¦"   18 minutes ago   Up 18 minutes             h01
82812ceefb42   arista/ceos:4.30.6M   "bash -c '/mnt/flashâ€¦"   18 minutes ago   Up 18 minutes             s01
783f209af70e   arista/ceos:4.30.6M   "bash -c '/mnt/flashâ€¦"   18 minutes ago   Up 18 minutes             l01
2839bc4a1ca7   arista/ceos:4.30.6M   "bash -c '/mnt/flashâ€¦"   18 minutes ago   Up 18 minutes             s02
47f9904801ce   arista/ceos:4.30.6M   "bash -c '/mnt/flashâ€¦"   18 minutes ago   Up 18 minutes             l02
```

# Access cEOS-lab CLI

<style scoped>section {font-size: 20px;}</style>

There are few options to access cEOS-lab CLI:

- SSH to the container. For ex.:
  
  ```bash
  # the default login is `admin` and password is `admin`
  ssh admin@l01
  ```

- Connect to the "console" using Docker command. For ex.: `docker exec -it l01 CLi`

  > NOTE: `docker exec -it l01 bash` allows to connect directly to the switch shell.

Execute few command to confirm that cEOS-lab is functioning:

- `show version`
- `show lldp neighbors`
- `show running-config`

---

# Destroy the Lab

<style scoped>section {font-size: 22px;}</style>

- Destroy the lab with `sudo containerlab destroy`  
- This will stop all containers, but will keep the files created by clab for the next run. For example, startup-configs.  
- Check the flash content for leaf1 and inspect it's startup config:

  ```console
  $ ls clab-build-clab-with-ceos/l01/flash
  AsuFastPktTransmit.log  SsuRestoreLegacy.log  debug             kickstart-config  startup-config
  Fossil                  aboot                 fastpkttx.backup  persist           system_mac_address
  SsuRestore.log          boot-config           if-wait.sh        schedule          tpm-data
  ```

- To remove these files and have a clean environment on the next run, use `--cleanup` flag:

  ```bash
  sudo containerlab destroy --cleanup
  ```

---

# Deploy the Lab with Custom Startup Config

<style scoped>section {font-size: 20px;}</style>

- Deploy the lab with the custom configuration:

  ```bash
  sudo containerlab deploy --debug --topo clab/topology.clab.yml --reconfigure
  ```

  > NOTE: `--reconfigure` is required if `--cleanup` flag was not specified in the previous step. Otherwise custom configs can be ignored and startup configs in `clab-build-clab-with-ceos/` will be used instead.

- Custom startup configs are located in the `clab/init-configs` directory and assigned to every node using `startup-config:` key in the `topology.clab.yml`. This allows creating pre-configured labs. In this workshop switches are preconfigured with a full EVPN MLAG setup. Host is pre-configured as well and should be able to ping the default gateway and diagnostic loopbacks of leaf switches:

  ```console
  $ ssh admin@h01
  Password:
  h01>en
  h01#ping 10.100.100.1
  h01#bash for i in {3..4}; do ping -c 4 100.64.101.${i}; done
  ```

---

# Additional Checks

Execute following commands on leaf1 to confirm that it is functioning as expected:

- `show ip bgp summary`
- `show bgp evpn summary`
- `show mlag`
- `show port-channel dense`

```console
l01#sh ip bgp summary 
BGP summary information for VRF default
Router identifier 100.65.255.3, local AS number 65101
Neighbor Status Codes: m - Under maintenance
  Description              Neighbor   V AS           MsgRcvd   MsgSent  InQ OutQ  Up/Down State   PfxRcd PfxAcc

```

# cEOS-lab Interface Mapping

<style scoped>section {font-size: 20px;}</style>

<div class="columns">
<div>

The lab with custom configs also has a custom interface mapping defined in `interface_mapping.json`.  
This can be useful to match real interface names, for example to have `Management1` interface on cEOS-lab instead of the default `Management0` or to get `EthernetX/X` style naming.  

To get `/` as part of an interface name you can simply use `_` (underscore) in cLab topology file. There is no need to define interface map for that. However management interface can only be renamed via interface mapping.

</div>
<div>

```json
{
    "ManagementIntf": {
        "eth0": "Management1"
    },
    "EthernetIntf": {
        "eth1_1": "Ethernet1/1",
        "eth2_1": "Ethernet2/1",
        "eth3_1": "Ethernet3/1",
        "eth4_1": "Ethernet4/1",
        "eth10_1": "Ethernet10/1"
    }
}
```

</div>
</div>

# Make Packet Capture

<style scoped>section {font-size: 22px;}</style>

- Every container has it's own Linux namespace. To list all interfaces for leaf1, execute following command:

  ```bash
  sudo ip netns exec l01 ip link
  ```

- Run following command and wait a few minutes to capture a BGP packets:

  ```bash
  sudo ip netns exec l01 tcpdump -nni eth1_1 port 179 -vvv
  ```

- You can clear BGP sessions on `l01` if it takes too long to capture keepalives: `clear ip bgp *`
- For additional details about packet capture check [cLab documentation](https://containerlab.dev/manual/wireshark/).

```console
$ sudo ip netns exec l01 tcpdump -nni eth1_1 port 179 -vvv

# Containerlab in a Container

<style scoped>section {font-size: 19px;}</style>

- Destroy the lab with cleanup flag: `sudo containerlab destroy --topo clab/topology.clab.yml --cleanup`
- It is possible to run the containerlab on the host without installing it by simply running it in a container. This is helpful on MacBooks (the only way to run cLab) and advanced use cases (like this workshop).
- Start Containerlab by using this command:

  ```bash
  docker run --rm -it --privileged \
    --network host \
    -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
    -v /etc/hosts:/etc/hosts \
    --pid="host" \
    -w $(pwd) \
    -v $(pwd):$(pwd) \
    ghcr.io/srl-labs/clab bash
  ```

- This will start the container in the interactive mode. Once in the container prompt, execute following command to start the lab:

  ```bash
  containerlab deploy --debug --topo clab/topology.clab.yml --reconfigure
  ```

- Destroy the lab with `containerlab destroy --topo clab/topology.clab.yml --cleanup` when ready and exit the container by typing `exit`.

---

# Containerlab in a Container (Non-Interactive)

<style scoped>section {font-size: 22px;}</style>

<div class="columns">
<div>

- Running cLab container in non-interactive mode is helpful to create shortcuts, etc.
- You can test it now or skip this step.
- Check [the documentation](https://containerlab.dev/install/#container) for additional details.

<div>

```bash
# deploy the lab
docker run --rm --privileged \

# Crafting Your Own Container

<style scoped>section {font-size: 22px;}</style>

- It is easy to craft your own container with Containerlab installed.
- You can check some Dockerfiles in [this repository](https://github.com/{{gh.repository}}) for inspiration or check [cLab documentation](https://containerlab.dev/install/#docker-in-docker)
- Possible reasons to create your own container:
  
  - Produce a consistent environment that is easy to share.
  - Pre-install additional tools. (Ansible, docker-in-docker, etc.)
  - Add aliases, etc.

- This workshop is a good example of an enviroment using a custom pre-build container with Docker-in-Docker and cLab

---

# Ansible with Containerlab

<style scoped>section {font-size: 22px;}</style>

- When containerlab starts it automatically creates Ansible inventory that can be used to automate certain tasks in the lab.
- Start the lab and inspect the inventory file: `cat clab-build-clab-with-ceos/ansible-inventory.yml`
- Check if ansible is already installed: `ansible --version`
- Install Ansible if it's not present:

  ```bash
  pip3 install "ansible-core>=2.14.0,<2.16"
  ansible-galaxy collection install ansible.netcommon
  ansible-galaxy collection install arista.eos
  # install community.general to support callback plugins in ansible.cfg, etc.
  ansible-galaxy collection install community.general
  ```

- Inspect `ansible.cfg` and make sure that it is matching your environment.
- Run the playbook: `ansible-playbook playbooks/check_the_lab.yml`
- The playbook will execute number of show commands on all switches in the lab and print output on the screen.

---

# Possible Caveats

<style scoped>section {font-size: 18px;}</style>

![bg right](img/pexels-danne-555709.jpg)

> WARNING: If you are planning to deploy a high scale lab, test it on a non-production host that you can access and recover any time. Incorrectly deployed Containerlab at scale can bring your host down due to high CPU utilization on start.

- It's always good to add `--max-workers` and `--timeout` flags to your containerlab deploy command.
- Use recent cEOS-lab version. 4.30 or higher is strongly recommended!
- cLab is creating a lot of files as root. That can cause permission issues. For example, make sure that all cLab files are gitignored:

  ```bash
  # ignore clab files
  clab-*
  *.bak
  ```

---

# Additional Scale Caveats

<style scoped>section {font-size: 18px;}</style>

- In the past Ubuntu used to have low `fs.inotify.max_user_instances` limit. On top, older cEOS-lab versions were decreasing this system limit to 1256. This was causing issues with high scale labs.
- On a modern system and any cEOS-lab later than 4.28 this system is high enough. 62800 is the default. Increasing this limit on a modern host with high memory is not causing any issues. Feel free to play with this parameter if required:

  ```bash
  # set system limit
  sudo sysctl -w fs.inotify.max_user_instances=62800
  # create 99-zceos.conf
  sudo sh -c 'echo "fs.inotify.max_user_instances = 62800" > /etc/sysctl.d/99-zceos.conf'
  # check the limit
  sudo sysctl -a  | grep -i inotify
  ```

  ```yaml
  topology:
  kinds:
    ceos:
